{"model_name": "qwq:latest", "status": "SUCCESS", "output": "Alright, I need to create a description for this new certificate program called \"Data Science Professional Certificate by KNIME.\" I have a list of course titles and descriptions to work with. Let's see how I can structure this.\n\nFirst, I should introduce what data science is and why it's important. Data science is all about extracting insights from data, and it's in high demand these days. So, maybe start with something like, \"Data science is revolutionizing industries by turning data into valuable insights.\"\n\nNext, I need to highlight the benefits of this certificate program. What will learners get out of it? Well, they'll gain skills in data science foundations, low-code/no-code tools like KNIME, artificial intelligence, machine learning, generative AI, and even some nontechnical skills. So, perhaps say something like, \"This certificate equips you with both technical and soft skills essential for a successful career in data science.\"\n\nNow, I should give a brief overview of what the courses cover. Looking at the list:\n\n- **Data Science Foundations: Fundamentals**: Basics of data science.\n\n- **Low Code/No-Code Data Literacy with KNIME**: Using KNIME for data analytics.\n\n- **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**: Overview of AI tools and techniques.\n\n- **Machine Learning and AI Foundations: Classification Modeling**: Strategies and algorithms for classification.\n\n- **Generative AI: Introduction to Large Language Models**: Understanding large language models.\n\n- **The Non-Technical Skills of Effective Data Scientists**: Nontechnical skills for data scientists.\n\nSo, maybe summarize it as, \"From foundational concepts to advanced techniques in AI and machine learning, plus essential soft skills, this program covers everything needed to become a proficient data scientist.\"\n\nFinally, I need a call to action. My previous descriptions all end with, \"Tune in, pass the final exam, and earn your certificate.\" So, I'll keep that consistent.\n\nPutting it all together, here's a draft:\n\n\"Data science is revolutionizing industries by turning data into valuable insights. This certificate equips you with both technical and soft skills essential for a successful career in data science. From foundational concepts to advanced techniques in AI and machine learning, plus essential soft skills, this program covers everything needed to become a proficient data scientist. Tune in, pass the final exam, and earn your certificate.\"\n\nLet me check the word count: 1, 2, 3,... total of 47 words. That's within the 40-60 word range.\n\nWait a minute, I should probably mention KNIME specifically since it's part of the program title. Maybe add that into the course overview section.\n\nHow about:\n\n\"Data science is revolutionizing industries by turning data into valuable insights. This certificate equips you with both technical and soft skills essential for a successful career in data science. Using tools like KNIME, you'll learn foundational concepts, advanced AI techniques, and essential soft skills needed to become a proficient data scientist. Tune in, pass the final exam, and earn your certificate.\"\n\nThat's 45 words. Still within range.\n\nAlternatively, I could be more specific about what learners will achieve. For example:\n\n\"Unlock the power of data with our Data Science Professional Certificate by KNIME. Gain essential skills from fundamentals to advanced AI techniques, including machine learning and generative models, all while developing crucial soft skills for a successful data science career. Tune in, pass the final exam, and earn your certificate.\"\n\nThat's 42 words.\n\nOr maybe emphasize the practical aspects:\n\n\"Embark on a journey to become a data science professional with our comprehensive certificate program powered by KNIME. Learn from basics to advanced AI, master machine learning techniques, explore generative models, and develop indispensable soft skills. Tune in, pass the final exam, and earn your certificate.\"\n\n46 words.\n\nI think any of these would work. I'll go with the second one:\n\n\"Unlock the power of data with our Data Science Professional Certificate by KNIME. Gain essential skills from fundamentals to advanced AI techniques, including machine learning and generative models, all while developing crucial soft skills for a successful data science career. Tune in, pass the final exam, and earn your certificate.\"\n\nIt's concise, covers the key points, and inspires learners to sign up.\n\n**Final Description:**\nUnlock the power of data with our Data Science Professional Certificate by KNIME. Gain essential skills from fundamentals to advanced AI techniques, including machine learning and generative models, all while developing crucial soft skills for a successful data science career. Tune in, pass the final exam, and earn your certificate.", "cold_boot": 872.6879978179932, "warm_boot": 546.7244687080383}
